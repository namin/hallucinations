Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen Chapter 1 It is a truth universally
acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must
be in want of a wife.  However little known the feelings or views of
such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is
so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is
considered the rightful property of some one or other of their
daughters.  "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day,
"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?" Mr. Bennet
replied that he had not.  "But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long
has just been here, and she told me all about it." Mr. Bennet made no
answer.  "Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife
impatiently.  "You want to tell me, and I have no objection to
hearing it." This was invitation enough.  "Why, my dear, you must
know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large
fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a
chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it,
that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take
possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in
the house by the end of next week.";
